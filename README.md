## Project Description
Wildlife across Queensland and Australia are faced with numerous threats, both environmental and man-made. It is a harsh reality that if action is not taken, we risk some species becoming threatened or extinct. Queensland is known for its variety of wildlife. With temperatures increasing and 60% of Queensland in drought, local wildlife volunteer groups come under strain, especially when some calls could be avoided if people had the right information. QWild aims to educate people on local wildlife in their area, help residents connect with their local environment and provide care instructions & contact numbers if they come across an injured animal.

QWild will encourage residents to learn more about the world around them and the species of wildlife that they share their backyards with, creating a greater sense of understanding and empathy. By providing an interactive experience, it will help foster appreciation for long term protection and conservation of the environment, both now and into the future.

# Technical Information

## AR Demo
Please note that the AR Demo for this project is located in [this repo](https://github.com/ivanvonchrist/ar-demo)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
